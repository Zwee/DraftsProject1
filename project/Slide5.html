        <p class="bump"><b>Whitespace</b> is the parts of the code where <u><em>there is no code</em></u>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whitespace is all the blank screen around the words. With other applications, like typing up a term paper in MS Word, whitespace can make a big difference. It can break up paragraphs, force text to display on an additional page, or make the text uncomfortable to read. But in HTML, <u>whitespace doesn't matter.(*)</u>
        </p>
        <p>
        It doesn't matter how many times you hit your 'space' or 'enter' keys: unless you tell the computer where the breaks are, it will show everything in one looooooooong line.
        <br>
        'Break' or &lt;br&gt; is a void tag (and an inline tag) that provides line breaks. It just says 'the line ends here'. &#40;Or, to quote Capt. Jean-Luc Picard: &quot;The line must be drawn here! This far, no further!&quot;&#41;
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><b>(*)
        </b> Unless we're talking about class selectors, but more on that later...</u>

      <img height="250" width="175" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zwee/Project/master/ZweeEggs.png" alt="Zwee painting eggs with 4 other ladies." title="Zwee painting eggs with 4 other ladies. Zwee has neon pink hair and is sporting a goofy look on her face while answering a question. She didn't know she was being photographed.">

          ...and what on earth is <b><u>alternate text?</b></u>
        </p>
          <b>Alt</b>, for 'alternate text', is often used in img (image) tags to provide an alternate output to the image if, for whatever reason, the picture did not download or wasn't available.
          <br>
          <p class="bump">
            Using alternate text is a good habit to get into:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-position:inside">
            <li>It lets users know that there was supposed to be something there, rather than just getting a blank spot on the page (or just a blank page, which is not a very precise error message to de-bug from).</li>
            <li>The alternate text can tell visually impaired people what's supposed to be there.</li>
            <li>(Again, note that there is no closing tag for this. &lt;img&gt; is a void tag.)</li>
            </ul>
